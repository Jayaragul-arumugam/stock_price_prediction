# LITERATURE REVIEW

## 1. Introduction to Stock Price Prediction
Stock price prediction remains a complex and high-stakes challenge due to the volatility and unpredictability of financial markets. Traditionally, statistical methods such as ARIMA and GARCH have been employed for forecasting. However, advancements in machine learning and deep learning have introduced more sophisticated techniques with the potential to enhance prediction accuracy.
## 2. Historical Stock Price Data
Historical stock price data is foundational for predictive modeling. It includes features such as closing prices, trading volumes, and moving averages. The author suggested that stock prices follow a random walk, indicating that past prices do not predict future prices. Despite this, models leveraging historical data can reveal patterns and trends that inform predictions. (Fama 1970)
## 3. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing, including normalization and scaling, is essential for preparing data for machine learning models. In the provided code, Min-Max scaling is used to normalize stock price data, ensuring equal contribution of all features during model training.(Mele 2012)
## 4. Moving Average Techniques
Moving averages, such as Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), are widely used in technical analysis to smooth price data and identify trends. Malkiel (2003) explores how moving averages help in recognizing long-term trends and making trading decisions. The code utilizes 100-day and 250-day moving averages to capture both short-term and long-term trends in stock prices.
## 5. Machine Learning Models
Machine learning models, particularly deep learning approaches like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have gained prominence for time series forecasting. LSTMs, introduced by “Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997)”, address the vanishing gradient problem in traditional RNNs, making them effective for sequential data such as stock prices. The provided code applies an LSTM model to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

## Data Overview:
•	Data Shape and Summary: The historical stock data for Google (GOOG) was successfully retrieved for the past 20 years. The dataset includes features such as 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Adj Close', and 'Volume'.
## Data Visualization:
•	Stock Price Trends: The adjusted closing prices over time were plotted, showing the historical trends and fluctuations of Google's stock price.
•	Moving Averages: Two moving averages (100-day and 250-day) were plotted alongside the adjusted closing prices. These moving averages help smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.
## Predictions and Performance:
•	Predictions: The model generated predictions for the test set, which were then inverse-transformed to original scale prices.
•	Comparison with Actual Prices: A plot comparing predicted and actual stock prices was created, illustrating the model’s performance in forecasting.
## Model Evaluation:
•	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The RMSE was calculated to measure the difference between the predicted and actual prices. A lower RMSE indicates better model performance, but exact values should be reviewed to assess accuracy.
## Results Visualization:
•	Prediction vs. Actual Plot: The plot showed how well the model's predictions matched the actual stock prices. This visual representation helps in understanding the accuracy of the model's forecasts.
## Model Performance:
•	Accuracy: The accuracy of the LSTM model is visually assessed through the comparison plot. The closer the predicted prices are to the actual prices, the better the model's performance.
•	Training Time and Epochs: The model was trained for a relatively short period (2 epochs). For improved performance, further tuning of the training duration, batch size, and epochs might be required.
## Data and Feature Engineering:
•	Data Scaling: Min-Max scaling was used to normalize the stock prices. This approach ensures that the input data is within a range suitable for the LSTM model.
